# quantum-algorithm-education

QAE is a website that I created to provide breakdowns of quantum algorithms. I wanted this site to be a cross between a wiki and a blog to showcase my understanding of these topics for post-graduate education, employers, etc. 
<br><br>
I also found that when I am trying to learn something, it's annoying when I forget some minute detail that was just learned in unison with 20 other concepts. 
<br><br>
For example, imagine reading about [Dirac notation](./src/pages/notation/dirac-notation.html), seems simple enough. But you go through the rest of the basics of quantum computation, learn some other concepts, and all of the sudden, you see this 
<br>
$$\\ket{-}$$
<br>
Not exactly intuitive...
<br><br>
So, now I have to now take a detour and re-learn that topic before proceeding with the material at hand, not ideal.
<br><br>
While I can't program a focused consciousness, I have made a point to take foreign concepts on any page, and display a modal explaining those concepts, so you can get all the information for the topic provided, without leaving the page! 
<br><br>

It is also important to note that I am teaching you how to understand quantum algorithms, not the entirety of quantum science. This means, while my linear algebra page may not cover every chapter I learned in class, it will cover the linear algebra needed for the quantum algorithms at a surface level.
