    <br><br><b>QAE</b> aims to provide education of quantum algorithms for free.
    <br><br>I designed this website to be in between a blog post and a wiki page. There are <button id="demo-open">modals</button> that provide information to any foreign topic, meaning that if the <br>
    information to understand a topic isn't on the current page, clicking a highlighted word will open a window that explains it. To me, this grants the user a smoother learning experience. Also note that these are all <br> 
    <b>interpretations</b> of the material I have studied. While all information is factual from cited material, you can get a more in depth <br>
    education on most these topics by studying something like <i>Nielsen and Chuang's "Quantum Computation and Quantum Information"</i>.

    <br><br><br><h3>About</h3>
    <p>QAE is a project I started in the latter half of the 2024 summer as I intend to pursue graduate education in quantum algorithm research. While most programs don't require an extensive knowledge of these quantum circuits, I saw an opportunity to mesh my love to teach others, with my summer studying of quantum algorithms.  </p>
    <p>What makes this website different? Well, there's no Nobel-level difference, but while studying, I've found that there is a lack of educational resources that are beginner friendly. It's a verbose and complex topic, there's potential that a website like this isn't even a step in the right direction for the education of quantum algorithms, but there was only one way to find out, and I'm happy with how it turned out.</p>
    <p>As I stated, I wanted to make this feel like a cross between a blog post, and a wiki page. I love the ideas of having modals that a user can click on when a foreign topic is presented. I find that it's a nice touch that sets this website apart, and at the end of the day, if you don't need them, just don't click them.</p>
    <p>Lastly, note that all material is 100% original. Obviously, I learned from a plethora of online resources, from the original research papers, to Qiskit's online resources, to random YouTube videos. However, all content was written by me. Likewise every image, circuit diagram, table, even the modal functionality, was created by me. Something I thought would be worth noting.</p>
