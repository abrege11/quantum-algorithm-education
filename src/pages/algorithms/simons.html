        [<a href="../index.html">\( \leftarrow \) back to home</a>]
        <p>Deutsch-Jozsa's algorithm provided a noticeable speedup from the classical counterpart, the Bernstein-Vazirani providing an even larger speedup. </p>
        <p>However, Simon's algrithm provides an exponential speedup from it's classical counterpart</p>
        <p>Simon's problem is another promise problem, it taking in \( n \) bit binary strings and returns \( m \) bit binary strings. Defined as</p>
        <button id="function-explanation-open">\[ f :\{0,1\}^n \longrightarrow \{0,1\}^m \]</button>
        <p>Like the Bernstein-Vazirani problem, we have a hidden string \( s \) that we are trying to find.</p>
        <p>Let's take a look at our promise</p>
        \[
        \left[ f(x) = f(y) \right] \Longleftrightarrow
        \left[ (x = y)\quad or \quad(x \oplus s = y) \right]
        \]
        <p>What is this promising us? It is promising us that \( f(x) = f(y) \) if and only if <br><br>&emsp;
        1. \( x = y \) <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;It is quite obvious why, this happens when \( s = 0^n \). <br>&emsp;&emsp;If \( s \) is an all 0 string, the <button id="bitwise-xor-open">bitwise \( XOR \) </button> of any string with an all 0 string, is just that string, so \( f(x) = f(y) \), making it a <b>one-to-one</b> function <br><br>
        or <br><br>&emsp; 
        2. \( x \oplus s = y \) <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;
        If the first promise isn't satisfied, that means that \( s \) is not an all 0 string, and it is a <b>two-to-one</b> function. <br>&emsp;&emsp;
        This means that for every input string \( x \) there is another string that f(x) maps to with the same output, and the second string must be the output of the \( x \oplus s \). <br>&emsp;&emsp;
        John Watrous states this very kindly - <br>&emsp;&emsp;
        <i>"Every \( n \) bit string \( x \) has a partner, and that partner is the string that we get by taking the bitwise \( XOR \) with the string s. Any two partners must give us the same output string." </i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wticzHE1vs">(55:40)</a>
        </p>
        <p>Let's take a look at the table when \( n = 3 \)</p>
        <img src="../../../assets/simons-table.png"><br>
        <p>How do we know what our hidden string \( s \) is? Well, let's look at our pairs, and \( XOR \) them to find out </p>
        \[
        000 \oplus 110 = 110
        \]
        \[
        001 \oplus 111 = 110
        \]
        \[
        010 \oplus 100 = 110
        \]
        \[
        111 \oplus 001 = 110
        \]
        <p>Something tells me that our hidden string \( s = 110 \)</p>
        <p>Now let's run through our <button id="circuit-open">circuit</button></p>
        <br><img src="../../../assets/simons.png"><br>
        <p>Notice we don't pass a \( \ket{1} \) into our circuit, this means that we won't be performing <button id="phase-kickback">phase kickback</button>.</p>
        <p>
            \( |\Psi_1\rangle \): <br>&emsp;
            Our ket at this time is 
            \[
            \ket{0}^{\otimes n}
            \] &emsp;
            Not much to say here, we haven't processed anything, so our stream of bits is simply n amounts of \( \ket{0} \)'s
        </p>
        <p>
            \( |\Psi_2\rangle \): <br>&emsp;
            We now send our top \( n \) \( \ket{0} \)'s into hadamarad gates, leaving us with the familiar state
            \[
            H\ket{0}^{\otimes n} \ket{0}^{\otimes n}
            \longrightarrow
            \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{x \in \{0,1\}^n} \ket{x} \ket{0}^{\otimes n}
            \] &emsp; 
            This is stating that we now have \( n \) qubits in a superposition state, along with \( n \) amounts of \( \ket{0} \)'s <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>    
            \( |\Psi_3\rangle \): <br>&emsp;
            Now, we have applied our oracle \( U_f \), which applies \( \ket{y \oplus f(x)} \) to our remaining \( \ket{0}^{\otimes n} \)
            \[
            U_f  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{x \in \{0,1\}^n} \ket{x} \ket{0}^{\otimes n} 
            \longrightarrow
            \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{x \in \{0,1\}^n} U_f \ket{x} \ket{0}^{\otimes n} 
            \longrightarrow
            \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{x \in \{0,1\}^n} \ket{x} \ket{f(x)}
            \]
        </p>
        <p>
            \( |\Psi_4\rangle \): <br>&emsp;
            With this state, we apply another hadamarad gate
            \[
            H^{\otimes n} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{x \in \{0,1\}^n} \ket{x} \ket{f(x)}
            \longrightarrow
            \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{x \in \{0,1\}^n} H\ket{x}^{\otimes n} \ket{f(x)}
            \]&emsp;
            So looking what H does for \( \ket{0} \) we can see what it will do for \( \ket{x}^{\otimes n} \)
            \[
            H\ket{0}^{\otimes n}
            \longrightarrow
            \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{x \in \{0,1\}^n} \ket{x}^{\otimes n}
            \] &emsp;
            So,
            \[
            H\ket{x}^{\otimes n}
            \longrightarrow
            \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{y \in \{0,1\}^n} (-1)^{x \cdot y} \ket{y}
            \] &emsp;
            And we can now redefine \( H\ket{x}^{\otimes n} \)
            \[
            \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{x \in \{0,1\}^n} \left( 
            \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{y \in \{0,1\}^n} (-1)^{x \cdot y} \ket{y}
            \right) \ket{f(x)}
            \] &emsp;
            Which we can rewrite as
            \[
            \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{y \in \{0,1\}^n} \sum_{x \in \{0,1\}^n} (-1)^{x \cdot y} \ket{y} \ket{f(x)}
            \]
        </p>
        <p>
            We now measure, and notice that similarly to Bernstein-Vazirani's algorithm, we measure the rightmost qubits, and drop the \( y \)
            \[
            \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{y \in \{0,1\}^n} \sum_{x \in \{0,1\}^n} (-1)^{x \cdot y} \ket{y} \ket{f(x)}
            \longrightarrow
            \]
            \[
            \left| \left| \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{x \in \{0,1\}^n} (-1)^{x \cdot y}\ket{f(x)} \right| \right|^2
            \]
            We see that we have to do two things<br><br>&emsp; 
            1. Evaluate for \( x \) possible \( n \) bit binary strings, which we will refer to as \( r(f) \), but can be formally stated as
            \[
            \{f(x)\, : x \, \in \textstyle\sum_{}^n \}
            \] &emsp;
            2. Evaluate for all r(f) when our condition \( f(x_1) = z \) is met, where \( x_1 \) denotes the current bitstring we are evaluating, and \( z \) denotes the bit string that <button id="promise-recall-open">satisfies our promise</button>, but formally is denoted by
            \[
            \{ x \, \in \textstyle\sum{}^n \, : \, f(x)=z \}
            \]
            Note, we must also evaluate for all outputs of \( z \) that derive from the \( XOR \) on the secret string s, this can be denoted by \( x_2 \)<br><br>
            \[
            x_1 \oplus s
            \]
            This means that we can rewrite our equation as
            \[
            \left| \left| 
            \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{z \in r(f)} \left( 
            \vphantom{\frac{ \ket{0} + \ket{1} }{\sqrt{2}}}
            (-1)^{x_1 \cdot y} + (-1)^{(x_1 \oplus s) \cdot y}
            \right) \ket{z}
            \right| \right|^2
            \]
            Notice that we can rewrite \( (x_1 \oplus s) \cdot y \) as \(( x_1 \cdot y \oplus s \cdot y )\)
            \[
            \left| \left| 
            \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{z \in r(f)} \left( 
            \vphantom{\frac{ \ket{0} + \ket{1} }{\sqrt{2}}}
            (-1)^{x_1 \cdot y} + (-1)^{( x_1 \cdot y \oplus s \cdot y )}
            \right) \ket{z}
            \right| \right|^2
            \]
            And factor out \( (-1)^{x_1 \cdot y} \)
            \[
            \left| \left| 
            \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{z \in r(f)} \left( 
            \vphantom{\frac{ \ket{0} + \ket{1} }{\sqrt{2}}}
            1 + (-1)^{(s \cdot y )}
            \right) \ket{z}
            \right| \right|^2
            \]
            \( z \) isn't relevant to our probability at the moment, so we can drop it and rewrite our expression as
            \[
            \bigg| 1+(-1)^{s \cdot y} \bigg|^2
            \]
            And finally, we see two output cases <br><br>
            &emsp; \( s \cdot y = 0 \)
            \[
            \bigg| 1+(-1)^{0} \bigg|^2 
            \longrightarrow
            \bigg| 1+1 \bigg|^2 
            \longrightarrow
            \bigg| 2 \bigg|^2 
            \longrightarrow
            4
            \]
            Generally, this is stated as <br><br> &emsp;
            \( s \cdot y = 0  \)
            \[
            \longrightarrow 
            \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}
            \]
            and <br><br>
            &emsp; \( s \cdot y = 1 \)
            \[
            \bigg| 1+(-1)^{1} \bigg|^2
            \longrightarrow
            \bigg| 1-1 \bigg|^2
            \longrightarrow
            0
            \]
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
            Now, we can process the outputs we have determined to get the final answer, we see that we have two final cases
            <br><br> &emsp;
            1. \( s = 0^n \)
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;
            This, as we already determined, will give us a trivial random string
            <br><br> &emsp;
            2. \( s \ne 0^n \)
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;
            <i>as \( s \cdot y = 1 \) has a probability of 0 to occur as proven, we will ignore it</i><br>&emsp;&emsp;
            When \( s \cdot y = 0 \), we have a \( \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \) chance to measure a string y <br><br>
            Well is this enough to determine \( s \)? Yes, because each time we run this algorithm, it narrows the margin of error. <br><br>
            For example, if \( n \) = 10, we have a 99.9% accuracy to recover the hidden string \( s \), good enough in my book.

            <b>This provides an exponential speedup to the classical counterpart.</b>
